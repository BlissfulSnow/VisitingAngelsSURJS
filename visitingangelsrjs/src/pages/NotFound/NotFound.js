// src/pages/NotFound.js

/*
The NotFound.js file defines a simple React component that serves as the 404 error page, displayed whenever a user navigates to a non-existent route. 
It imports React and returns a basic message with an <h1> heading indicating a "404 - Page Not Found" error, followed by a paragraph apologizing for the missing page. 
This component is exported and used as a fallback in the main App.js file to handle undefined routes, providing a user-friendly response to invalid URLs.

	return (
		<div className="not-found">
			<h1>404 - Page Not Found</h1>
			<p>Sorry, the page you are looking for does not exist.</p>
		</div>
	);
}
