// src/index.js

/*
The index.js file serves as the primary entry point for the React application, connecting the root App component to the HTML document. 
It imports the core React library, ReactDOM for rendering to the DOM, and the App component that defines the appâ€™s structure and routing. 
Using ReactDOM.render(), it wraps App in <React.StrictMode> to highlight potential issues and mounts it to the <div id="root"> element in public/index.html, ensuring the app displays correctly in the browser. 
This file is essential for initializing the application and rendering it to the DOM.

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
	<React.StrictMode>
		<App/>
